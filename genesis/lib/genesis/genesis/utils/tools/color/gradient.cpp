/**
 * @brief Returns a Color that is created using a color gradient.
 *
 * The function takes a color gradient in form of a map from double to Color.
 * The keys in the map are offset positions between 0.0 and 1.0. The keys 0.0 and 1.0 need to
 * be the lowest and highest keys in the map, respectively. Otherwise, an `std::invalid_argument`
 * is thrown. An arbitrary number of keys in between these boundaries is allowed.
 *
 * Each key is associated with a Color value, which indicates the color at that position.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *     // Prepare gradient ranges.
 *     auto ranges = std::map<double, Color>();
 *     ranges[ 0.0 ] = Color(   0, 255, 0 );
 *     ranges[ 0.5 ] = Color( 255, 255, 0 );
 *     ranges[ 1.0 ] = Color( 255,   0, 0 );
 *
 *     // Get color at 30% of the green-yellow-red gradient.
 *     Color c = gradient( ranges, 0.3 );
 *
 * This map defines the same gradient that is used for `heat_gradient`.
 *
 * The second parameter of this function then takes the position (again, between 0.0 and 1.0) at
 * which the gradient is evaluated. Values outside of the interval `[0.0, 1.0]` are set to the
 * closest interval border value (so, either 0.0 or 1.0).
 *
 * For example, given the range map above, a percentage value of 0.0 gives green; 0.5 gives yellow;
 * 1.0 gives red; values in between are interpolated accordingly.
